## Introduction

This is the repository for a tutorial that teaches how to set up a server side rendered web application using Django and Nuxt.js. 

## Requirements
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
* [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/)
* [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/))
